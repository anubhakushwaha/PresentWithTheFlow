# PresentWithTheFlow

* Tired of keeping track of what the presentation is all about when going to a meetup ? 
* Reached late and can't see the presentation screen ?
* Always worried if you will get a projector to present or not ?
* Event done, not getting the presentations of speakers, pinging organizers ?
* Concerned about internet connectivity ?

If you have ever faced any of the above problems, **PresentWithTheFlow** is what you need to checkout.

This app enables a **Presenter** and a **Viewer** view where the app completely works offline and allows the presenter to in-sync present the slides to their audience in real-time. This way as the presenter moves from one slide to any other slide, in real-time the slides of the attendees changes as well.
